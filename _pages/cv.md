Research
--------

My research focuses on modelling populations in space and time. Currently I am working on using these models to identify vulnerable demographic features, investigate habitat associations and provide evidence-based advice for land managers and conservationists. I have projects involving birds, mammals, invertebrates and amphibians in the Great Britain, Ireland, South East Asia and the Caribbean. I have a keen interest in the use of computational methods in ecology and environmental science and believe that the use of novel computational techniques has the potential to answer many questions in ecology and conservation. I currently supervise  several MRes students working on topics related to conservation biology and ecology. I am also involved in supervising PhD students and have experience as an examiner for PhD qualifications.

__PhD - The long term viability of black grouse (_Tetrao tetrix_) populations in a changing upland landscape__  
_Manchester Metropolitan University, Division of Biology and Conservation Ecology_  

Using modelling approaches to investigate population change and long-term viability in a black grouse population.
Habitat suitability models, primarily MaxEnt, are used to investigate the effect of habitat change on this population.
Original models, written in R, are used to simulate and assess future habitat scenarios for black grouse conservation.

# Local adaptation in Scottish dragonflies: implications in a changing climate

_w/ Dr. Anna Muir_  

The Scottish Highlands are a stronghold for a number of dragonfly species of conservation concern within the UK. However, little is known about how populations use breeding pool complexes, whether different populations are adapted to specific local conditions, and how this relates to connectivity and genetic diversity. The potential to acclimatise or evolve in response to novel environmental conditions is an important predictor of survival in a changing climate. Therefore, experimental studies are needed to assess developmental parameters in dragonflies in a range of environmental conditions.
	This project will carry out common-garden experiments using individuals collected in the field in Scotland in collaboration with Forestry and Land Scotland. The student will carry out fieldwork to collect larvae and follow their developmental progress in the lab in multiple temperature treatments. There may also be the opportunity to use molecular techniques to assess genetic diversity across the sampled populations. The results of this study will be used to form conservation recommendations with key stakeholders.

Small, isolated populations are at high risk of local extinction due to loss of genetic variability and
associated reduction in fitness. Therefore, knowledge of population size and genetic diversity in
isolated populations is vital in order to prioritise conservation actions and recover populations that
are at risk. The natterjack toad (_Epidalea calamita_) is endangered and legally protected in Britain
and exists in less than 40 locations, making it of high conservation concern. One native natterjack
toad site lies on the edge of the Dee Estuary at Cheshire Wildlife Trust’s Red Rocks Nature Reserve. The historical population declined to extinction in the early 90’s and was reintroduced from a source population in North Merseyside However, due to the lack of suitable surrounding coastal dune habitat, the natterjack toad
population at Red Rocks is now thought to be completely isolated and concerns have been raised
that population numbers are low. Therefore, knowledge of population size and genetic diversity of
the natterjack toads at this site are vital to avoid a second local extinction event.
This project will involve collection of non-invasive samples in the field and will use conservation
genetic techniques, including microsatellite markers and genetic capture-recapture, to: 1) quantify
the number of individuals within the population; and 2) assess the genetic diversity of the
population. The results of this study will be used to form conservation recommendations with
Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The ideal candidate will have previous experience of laboratory work (including DNA extraction
and PCR) and access to a vehicle for fieldwork.

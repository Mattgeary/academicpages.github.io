## Using Camera Traps to Assess mammal communities in East Africa

Many mammal species are difficult to survey due to nocturnal or crepuscular habits, low detectability and cryptic behaviour. Camera traps offer a solution to many of these issues by allowing scientists to survey remotely, for long periods and during all times of the day and night. Camera traps are currently being deployed in Uganda to monitor Giant Pangolin populations and this project would focus on using these cameras to investigate the mammal communities which share Gaint Pangolin habitat and burrows. The project will involve using previously collected camera trap images to identify species such as Aardvark, wild pig, Porcupine and Honey Badger. The distribution of these species could then be related to surrounding habitat features. This information will contribute to a wider collaboration between the University and Chester Zoo focusing on Giant Pangolin.  This project would suit a student who has good IT skills and some experience of GIS. A field visit to Uganda to assist with ongoing camera trapping work is possible as part of this project.
